# Letter to Myself (Session Handoff)

**Date:** 2026-02-04 18:30 CET

## 1. Executive Summary
* **Goal:** Complete Airtable integration for lead capture and fix 404 page errors
* **Current Status:** All code changes deployed, waiting for Vercel environment variables to be configured

## 2. The "Done" List (Context Anchor)
* Created `/blog` page at `src/app/blog/page.tsx` with 3 placeholder articles
* Created `/karriere` page at `src/app/karriere/page.tsx` with benefits and job application section
* Committed and pushed both pages (commit: 46cf8e9)
* Previous session: Set up Airtable fields via API, updated `AirtableLead` interface to use `Lead Status`

## 3. The "Pain" Log (CRITICAL)
* **Tried:** Pushing commit with API key in `.memory/letter_20260204_0002.md`
* **Failed:** GitHub push protection blocked due to secret detection
* **Workaround:** Removed API key from memory file, replaced with placeholder text, amended commit
* *Note:* Never include actual API keys in memory files - use placeholders

* **Tried:** Form submission on production Vercel
* **Failed:** Error displayed (environment variables not configured on Vercel)
* **Workaround:** User needs to manually add env vars in Vercel dashboard
* *Note:* `.env.local` only works locally; Vercel needs separate configuration

## 4. Active Variable State
* Local `.env.local` configured with all Airtable credentials
* Vercel environment variables **NOT YET CONFIGURED** - this is blocking production form submissions
* Required Vercel env vars:
  - `AIRTABLE_API_KEY` (user has the value)
  - `AIRTABLE_BASE_ID=appJTjiLnhYIjHnGN`
  - `AIRTABLE_TABLE_NAME=tblgBqNy2rJN6XLW8`

## 5. Immediate Next Steps
1. [ ] User must add environment variables in Vercel dashboard (Settings → Environment Variables)
2. [ ] User must redeploy or trigger new deployment after adding env vars
3. [ ] Test form submission on production after env vars are configured
4. [ ] Optionally: Add Resend API key for email functionality (currently placeholder)
5. [ ] Optionally: Clean up unused Airtable default fields (Name, Notes, Assignee, Status, Attachments)
